This version of the PNT-CAT Shiny app is intended for research purposes. It includes a 30- 60- and full PNT administrations. It currently excludes "tank" from the practice items and "Eskimo" from the full PNT items. We recommend using this app locally by installing the package via the r package {remotes}.

```
remotes::install_github("aphasia-apps/pnt.reserach")
```

After installing, the app can be run by calling:

```
pnt.research::runApp()
```
