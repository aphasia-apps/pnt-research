# This script runs each response from the observed 24 participants through the app
# right now its not using key presses, but a radio button and action button
# because I can't figure out how to input the key presses in the unit test. 
# Basically, there are hidden inputs (will never be shown) that take the same
# input "1" and "2"
# the inputs are the same otherwise though. 
# it returns a .csv file for each participant and saves it in the tests tests_output folder
# there is another script called "process_test_data.R"
# that processes the output of this unit test. 

## !!!! Call this script using shinytest.R 

# things to change to enable test to run:
# app title in text.R
# reset("keys)
